This repository contains the codes for paper **End-to-End Low Cost Compressive Spectral Imaging with Spatial-Spectral Self-Attention** (***ECCV (2020)***) by [Ziyi Meng*](https://github.com/mengziyi64), [Jiawei Ma*](https://github.com/Phoenix-V), [Xin Yuan](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/x.yuan) (*Equal contributions).

## Overviewer
Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging ([CASSI](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-47-10-B44)) is an effective tool to capture real-world 3D hyperspectral images. We have proposed a Spatial-Spectral Self-Attention module to jointly model the spatial and spectral correlation in an order-independent manner, which is incorporated in an encoder-decoder network to achieve high quality reconstruction for CASSI.
